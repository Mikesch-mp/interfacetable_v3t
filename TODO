# Todo for 0.03
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# DONE    - option to enable/disable change tracking for interfaces going from 
#           down to up
#           -> preferred to force that behaviour, don't see why using the other 
#              one.
# DONE    - snmp v2c & v3 support
# DONE    - think about the use 64 bits counters
# DONE    - see if the short (old) plugin output is really relevant or can be 
#           simply replaced by the long output
#           -> long output is now default, unique --outputshort and --perfdatashort
               options are now in place to switch to less detailed outputs
# DONE    - add check and threshold options for packet errors/discards
# DONE    - check and remove the % character if any in some commandline arguments
# DONE    - dissociate load calculation/checking from port perfdata selection
#           -> to allow to select particular interface for properties tracking,
#              while the other interfaces are still checked for traffic load and
#              perfdata well generated
# DONE    - add a little icon in each field of the interface table which correspond 
#           to a tracked property
#           -> preferred a different bg color via css, more flexible and less 
#              cumbersome 
# DONE    - move all html style properties from the generated html page to a css
#           stylesheet. To allow easier customisation of the generated html page.
# DONE    - css stylesheets
# DONE    - extend the debug with new debug levels. Might be in the model of 
#           an addition of 0/1/2/4/8/16/32/64 to really select what is needed...
#            -> prefered to keep a standard way with levels (currently 0-3).
#               reviewed, added loglevel 0 for critical errors
# DONE    - config file feature. Using the --config option, a config file can be 
#           loaded. (really useful? lets see...)

#         - info table (first table) building way review for more flexibility
#         - review general structure of the plugin

#           against the use of unix snmpwalk
#         - add STP info
#         - add Cisco specific port info
#         - add a feature to anonymize the info in debug reports (script or option?)
