# 	 - option to enable change tracking for interfaces going from down to up
# 	 - add GetSnmpWalkxxxxx -> use of get_table and evaluate performances
# 	   against the use of unix snmpwalk
#    - rewrite the way the fields in the info table are selected for more 
#      flexibility
#    - snmp v2c / v3 support
#    - extend the debug with new debug levels. Might be in the model of 
#      an addition of 0/1/2/4/8/16/32/64 to really select what is needed...
#    - info table (first table) building way review for more flexibility
#    - review general structure of the plugin
#    - see if the short (old) plugin output is really relevant or can be 
#      simply replaced by the long output
#    - add check and threshold options for packet errors/discards
#    - check and remove the % character if any in the commandline arguments
#    - dissociate load calculation/checking from port perfdata selection
#      -> to allow to select particular interface for properties tracking,
#         while the other interfaces are still checked for traffic load and
#         perfdata well generated
#    - add a little icon in each field of the interface table which correspond 
#      to a tracked property
