# Todo for 0.04-2
#  => (cancelled as no major bugs and no time to release. everything will be available in 0.05)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# DONE    - settings.cfg renamed settings.cfg-sample to avoid settings overwrite during upgrades
# DONE    - convert sysLocation from hex to string when needed
# DONE    - fix wrong old variable in settings.cfg
# DONE    - max bandwidth monitoring capacity, recommendation on switching to 32/64 counters and delta
# DONE    - added total bytes to graph in pnp4nagios templates (Markus Frosch)

# Todo for 0.05
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# IN PROG - better non regression testing
#            -> test phase would include tests on simulated type of monitored nodes
#         - multiple spanning tree support (currently only default vlan for cisco). Maybe 
#           use stpxInconsistentState?
#         - add a feature to anonymize the info in debug reports (script or option?)
#         - review normalization for a more standard one available in perl and php
#         - add support of Fabric OS Firmware < v5.3.0 (Brocade) 
#         - add a 4th table in the html page, giving some specific device info,
#           depending on the nodetype option
#         - evaluate a system where properties changing from empty to a value are not
#           reported as a problem
#         - better support of IP info for HP Procurve switches
#         - support for Brocade with FabricOS < v5.3.0
#         - support of "BIG-IP Local Traffic Manager" (and maybe other devices of that vendor)
# IN PROG - nodetype "netapp(filer)" + model/product node info + 64-bit counters 
#           + extended 32-bit counters (low/high)
#         - epn support back
#         - add an option for debug output in a file
#         - add feature for second ifSpeed in asymetrical links (such as a DSL line or cable 
#           modem) where the download and upload speeds are different 
#         - css theme switching feature (mostly for validity checks)
#         - option for (re-)adding/remove some bw stats
#         - in unixsnmp mode, switching any remaining use of net-snmp perl binding
# IN PROG - enhance code flexibility for easier device support extension
#         - infobulle pkt err/discard
#         - notes and recommendations in the config table
# IN PROG - perfdata in bps instead of counters. experimental phase
# IN PROG - contribution integrations

# Ideas in vrac
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#         - add support (+ templates) for other graphers (nagiosgraph, perfparse,...)
#         - option to show mac addresses in the interface table
#         - multiple tables (physical interfaces separated from logical interfaces)
#         - change from html files to php interface and datafiles
#         - netscreen - handle secondary IPs
#         - evaluate last traffic calculation by Netways, see commit:  https://git.netways.org/?p=check_interface_table.git;a=blobdiff;f=libexec/check_interface_table_v3t.pl.in;h=f6069fc8ee386bb75caf01461db620e9c8d394b8;hp=0a39069b702f2b383fe9d31a0e0f97b0d6a13f07;hb=be1587e1fcdda073ca9d034a8b38e91e4faa0580;hpb=4ff2b44cb89c289e1555dbee4b5c4dcabfda51e3
#         - for cisco devices, retrieve CRC errors and collisions (in addition/instead of in errors and out errors?)
#         - nobulk option as an alias to max-repetitions=1
#         - detection of the case http://www.tontonitch.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1649, 
#           where bulk requests are not well supported by the target device
#         - switch to full php + jquery
#         - store state + table info in xml
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Cancelled
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#         - review the netwaysgrapherv2 support + create templates
#            -> the solution is not developed anymore
