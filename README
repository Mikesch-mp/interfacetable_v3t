check_interface_table_v3t.pl is a Nagios(R) plugin that allows you to monitor
the network interfaces of a node (e.g. router, switch, server) without knowing 
each interface in detail. Only the hostname (or ip address) and the snmp community 
string are required.

check_interface_table_v3t.pl comes from:
    1. check_interface_table.pl: 
       released by ITdesign Software Projects & Consulting. this is the first 
       version of the plugin, extracted from the commercial suite proposed by 
       ITdesign.
    2. check_interface_table_v2.pl: released by NETWAYS GmbH, it adds the 
       performance data related to bandwidth usage.

This new version, called v3t, is/will propose lots of enhancements, pnp4nagios 
support, much more documented plugin options, be closer to nagios plugin guidelines,
snmp v2 & v3 support, and much more !

For curious, 't' in v3t stand for 'tontonitch' (my pseudo)
