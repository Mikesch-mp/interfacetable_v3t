# 	 - enhancement: debug mode review

#      functions 
# 	 - enhancement: cleaning of unused blocks of code. might be reviewed 
#      in the future
# 	 - enhancement: added comments
# 	 - enhancement: added bits output feature for performance data
# 	 - enhancement: check_multi perfdata output type with interface name. 
#      Global and Port perfdata types
# 	 - enhancement: rewrite the plugin to follow the nagios plugin development 
#      guidelines:

# 	 - enhancement: pnp6 templates
# 	 - enhancement: separate history cleaning and dataset selection from bps 
#      calculation
#    - enhancement: restricted the html link generated as the pluging output

#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# * v2->v3t0.0x
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#    - enhancement: cleaner and step-by-step output when resetting stats
#    - enhancement: finished option 'track', replacement of nochange, which 
#      list the field concerned by tracking. Default: only ifOperStatus.
#    - enhancement: replaced column name/field notations from csv style to 
#      arrays
#    - enhancement: clearly referenced html tables in variable names for 
#      better maintenance
#    - fix: some typo fixes
#    - fix: readded 'human' option (previously missed)
#    - fix: some 'variable not defined' problems
#    - added operstatus as performance data for interface status tracking
#    - enhancement: don't alert for interfaces OperStatus going to "up"
#    - fix: vlan column moved to the correct place
#    - enhancement: avoid global perfdata to be returned in case of initial
#      run or no history, as the perfdata are wrong and produce drops on 
#      graphs
#    - enhancement: rewrite the plugin to follow the nagios plugin development 
#      guidelines:
# 	   * use of "use warnings"
#         => second review, protected lots of undefined variables
#    - enhancement: added excludeportperf and includeportperf, allowing 
#      to filter which tracked interfaces generates performance data
#    - fix/enhancement: port performance data now depend on what data are 
#      available. ex: unrouted vlans doesn't have ifOctetIn... statistics
#    - enhancement: last traffic calculation a bit cleaned and commented for
#      better maintenance
#    - fix: corrected and completed physical interface pattern matching in
#      check_for_unused_interfaces
#    - fix: readded 'regexp' option (previously missed)
#    - fix: cachedir/statedir naming including hostquery
#    - fix: never ignore case in options

# ========================================================================
# 	TODO list:
# 	 - option to enable change tracking for interfaces going from down to up
# 	 - add GetSnmpWalkxxxxx -> use of get_table and evaluate performances
# 	   against the use of unix snmpwalk
# 	 - review the nagios plugin development guidelines to see if it fits now
# 	 - pnp6 templates update
#    - snmp v2c / v3 support
