#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# * 0.02
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
#    - enhancement: cleaner and step-by-step output when resetting stats
#    - feature: finished option 'track', replacement of nochange, which 
#      list the field concerned by tracking. Default: only ifOperStatus.
#    - enhancement: replaced column name/field notations from csv style to 
#      arrays
#    - enhancement: clearly referenced html tables in variable names for 
#      better maintenance
#    - bugfix: some typo fixes
#    - bugfix: readded 'human' option (previously missed)
#    - bugfix: some 'variable not defined' problems
#    - feature: added operstatus as performance data for interface status tracking
#    - enhancement: don't alert for interfaces OperStatus going to "up"
#    - bugfix: vlan column moved to the correct place
#    - bugfix: avoid global perfdata to be returned in case of initial
#      run or no history, as the perfdata are wrong and produce drops on 
#      graphs
#    - enhancement: rewrite the plugin to follow the nagios plugin development 
#      guidelines:
# 	   * use of "use warnings"
#         => multiple reviews and finally done
#    - enhancement: added excludeportperf and includeportperf, allowing 
#      to filter which tracked interfaces generates performance data
#    - bugfix: port performance data now depend on what data are 
#      available. ex: unrouted vlans doesn't have ifOctetIn statistics on catalyst
#    - enhancement: last traffic calculation a bit cleaned and commented for
#      better maintenance
#    - bugfix: corrected and completed physical interface pattern matching in
#      check_for_unused_interfaces
#    - bugfix: readded 'regexp' option (previously missed)
#    - bugfix: cachedir/statedir naming including hostquery
#    - bugfix: never ignore case in options
#    - enhancement: reviewed the way the ports are counted. based on the 
#      speed property availability, this seems to permit a correct counting 
#      for most of the possible nodes (cisco, windows, linux, ...)
#    - feature: option "cisco" for specific cisco info requests and printing
#    - bugfix: fixed some options no properly interpreted
#    - bugfix: now checking the IP info <-> interface mapping  
#    - feature: 2 new output cases, reflecting the leak of data for 
#      calculation. For initial run and for no valid historical dataset
#    - feature: operstatus in pnp4nagios port templates, for easier  
#      interface status tracking.
#    - enhancement: normal plugin output includes now load thresholds
#    - feature: --grapher and --grapherurl options to specify which grapher
#      solution is used. And alternative url can be specified. 
#    - feature: --short or --long options for less or more detailed plugin 
#      outputs. Using --long allow to clearly identify problematic interfaces
#      directly in the output of the plugin
#    - enhancement: some options can now be specified multiple times and are
#      concatenated. Exemple: --exclude 'pat1' --exclude 'pat2,pat3'. 
#      Concerned options: track, exclude, include, excludeportperf, 
#      includeportperf
#    - feature: added an option to print the default values of the options
#    - enhancement: updated the pod doc and moved to end for better reading.
#    - enhancement: data::dumper sorting
#    - enhancement: removed man option (prefered perldoc reading)
#    - enhancement: reviewed the way the operstatus is presented for 
#      $display_operstatus = 1 (separate graph for operstatus)
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# * 0.01
#   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# 	 - enhancement: better pnp4nagios integration
# 	 - enhancement: better documentation on usage
# 	 - enhancement: parameters treatment block code, for easier maintenance
# 	 - enhancement: debug mode review
# 	 - enhancement: arrays in option hash to avoid reformating in sub 
#      functions 
# 	 - enhancement: cleaning of unused blocks of code. might be reviewed 
#      in the future
# 	 - enhancement: added comments
# 	 - feature: added bits output feature for performance data
# 	 - enhancement: check_multi perfdata output type with interface name. 
#      Global and Port perfdata types
# 	 - enhancement: rewrite the plugin to follow the nagios plugin development 
#      guidelines:
# 	   * use of "use warnings"
# 	 - feature: pnp6 templates
# 	 - enhancement: separate history cleaning and dataset selection from bps 
#      calculation
#    - enhancement: restricted the html link generated as the pluging output 
#      to "[detail]", for better integration in third party tools such as 
#      nagstamon,...
